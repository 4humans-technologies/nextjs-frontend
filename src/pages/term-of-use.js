            You can purchase tokens and tip them to any model you like. We offer
            different token packages for you to purchase. We may change the
            price of tokens from time to time to offer you special offers. Like
            in every other website, you should use a valid credit card and
            provide us with certain information to proceed with the purchase.{" "}
            <br />
            You must purchase “tokens” which you can then use to give you full
            use of additional features of the Website. Prices for tokens will be
            posted on the Website and may change from time to time in our sole
            discretion. Prices are subject to change and may vary due to various
            reasons, including special and limited promotional offers. All
            payments, including for token purchases, must be made with your
            valid credit card or debit card or other available payment method,
            the information of which may be kept on file by us or by our payment
            processors (“Filed Payment Details”). Fees for tokens must be paid
            in advance of you using them. <br />
            In order to make a purchase, you may be asked to supply certain
            information to allow us to process and authorize your purchase,
            including, without limitation, your name, address, card number, card
            expiration date, card security number and other information. You
            represent and warrant that (i) you have the legal right to use form
            of payment that you use and that (ii) the information that you are
            providing with that form of payment is true and correct. You
            acknowledge that we may use a third party for the purposes of
            processing or facilitating any payment and that by submitting your
            information to us you grant us the right to provide this information
            to such third parties. <br />
            We reserve the right to refuse, cancel or terminate your order for
            any time and for any reason in our sole discretion. Without limiting
            the foregoing, we reserve the right to refuse, cancel or terminate
            your order because of product or service unavailability, errors in
            the description or price of our product or service and errors in
            your order. <br />
            <br />
            YOUR FILED PAYMENT DETAILS MAY BE AUTOMATICALLY CHARGED FOR YOUR
            FUTURE PURCHASES OR FOR ANY RECURRING PURCHASES WHICH YOU HAVE

            PAYMENT PROCESSORS WE MAY USE) TO CHARGE YOUR FILED PAYMENT DETAILS
            FOR SUCH PAYMENTS ON YOUR BEHALF. <br /> <br />
            By enabling the auto-refill feature on the Website, you hereby
            expressly give your permission for us to automatically charge your
            last payment details on file, with an amount equivalent to your last
            purchase, as soon as the tokens in your account get below a chosen
            threshold. You can always opt-out from the auto-refill feature at
            any time, by going to your account's "Settings". <br />
            You agree not to report as fraudulent, lost or stolen any form of
            payment which you have used in conjunction with payment to us, for
            which you do not have a good faith reason to believe is in fact
            fraudulent, lost or stolen. You agree not to report as unauthorized
            any charge by us for any goods or services, including subscriptions,
            for which you do not have a good faith reason to believe is in fact
            unauthorized. You agree that, absent good faith, in the event of any
            such report you shall be liable to us for such charge or obligation
            plus an additional $100 administrative fee. The liability specified
            in this paragraph will not limit our rights or any other liability
            you may have for any other reason, including a breach of any other
            provision of these Terms. <br /> <br />
            Refunds: <br /> If at any time we terminate your rights to use the
            Website because of a breach of these Terms, you shall not be
            entitled to a refund of any portion of your unused tokens. In all
            other respects, such fees shall be governed by additional rules,
            terms, conditions or agreements posted on the Website and/or imposed
            by any sales agent or payment processing company, as may be amended
            from time to time. <br />
            Without limiting the foregoing, we may in our discretion refund you
            tokens when there are technical problems with the Website (i.e.,
            when the Website malfunctions and takes your tokens) or when you
            have had a provably unsatisfactory private show (in which case, you
            must end the show as soon as possible). However, we will never
            refund tokens when you have given a tip (as tips are gifts and
            cannot be reversed) or when you are spying on another person’s
            private show. <br />
            <br />
            Inactive accounts: <br />
            If a period of inactivity is detected in your account (ie you
            neither use your account nor purchase any tokens, then we reserve
            the right and at our sole discretion to terminate your rights to use
            the Website. <br />
            In such a case, you hereby expressly accept, agree and acknowledge
            that any portion of your unused tokens is forfeited by you and
            cannot subsequently be recovered. <br />
