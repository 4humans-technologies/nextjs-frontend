            We take appropriate security measures (including physical,
            electronic and procedural measures) to safeguard your personal data
            from unauthorized access and disclosure. For instance, only
            authorized employees are permitted to access personal data, and they
            may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we use
            encryption in the transmission of your personal data between your
            system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized
            persons from gaining access to your personal data. However, please
            be advised that we cannot fully eliminate security risks associated
            with the storage and transmission of personal data as we cannot
            guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party
            hackers from illegally obtaining this information.

            Some of our external third parties are based outside the European

            involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.
            <br /> Whenever we transfer your data outside the EEA, we ensure a
            similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least
            one of the following safeguards is implemented:

            </li>

              b) Where we use service providers outside the EEA, we may use
              specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give

              c) Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to
              them if they are part of the EU-US Privacy Shield, which requires
              them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between
              the European Union and the US.

            To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we

            your personal information that is necessary for compliance and legal

            As of January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018
            (“CCPA”) provides California residents (“Consumer(s)”) certain
            rights with respect to their personal information, as this term is
            defined under the CCPA. In addition to the rights we state under
            this policy and subject to the exceptions found under the CCPA,
            Consumers have the right to:

              sufficient to allow us to verify the identity of the Consumer in
              question and to locate his/her information in our systems;

              services for exercising any of their CCPA rights, unless as
