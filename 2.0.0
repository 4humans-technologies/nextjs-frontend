 WARN  deprecated querystring@0.2.1: The querystring API is considered Legacy. new code should use the URLSearchParams API instead.
 WARN  deprecated core-js-pure@3.19.1: core-js-pure@<3.23.3 is no longer maintained and not recommended for usage due to the number of issues. Because of the V8 engine whims, feature detection in old core-js versions could cause a slowdown up to 100x even if nothing is polyfilled. Some versions have web compatibility issues. Please, upgrade your dependencies to the actual version of core-js-pure.
